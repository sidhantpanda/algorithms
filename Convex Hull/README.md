# Convex Hull Algorithms

This directory contains some of the interesting convex hull algorithms. I'll be updating the readme whenever I add another algorithm.

[Chan's Algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chan%27s_algorithm "Chan's Algorithm Wikipedia") - This is a simplest of all the convex hull algorithms. This is an output sensitive algorithm and takes O(nlogh) time, where *h* is the number of vertices of the hull.

[Gift Wrapping Algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_wrapping_algorithm "Gift Wrapping Algorithm") - Also known as Jarvis March, runs in O(*nh*) time.
